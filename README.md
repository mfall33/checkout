WHAT NEEDS DONE

--Payment success screen (ORDER CONFIRMATION SCREEN) should maybe mention receiving an email about the order instead of saying the order has been confirmed (can send out an email from stripe webhook API if successful).
--Internal code cleanup and reflect on project structure (make changes where best suited).
--Need to try and bring screens away from "use client" utilize the server more.
--Seperate some logic out into hooks.
