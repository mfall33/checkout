.env files are scattered across .env and next.config.js

WHAT NEEDS DONE

--login/login issue.
--Seperate some logic out into hooks.
--Need to try and bring screens away from "use client" utilize the server more.
--Internal code cleanup and reflect on project structure (make changes where best suited).
--Payment success screen (ORDER CONFIRMATION SCREEN) should maybe mention receiving an email about the order instead of saying the order has been confirmed (can send out an email from stripe webhook API if successful).
