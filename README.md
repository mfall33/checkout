.env files are scattered across .env and next.config.js

WHAT NEEDS DONE

--Swap any non caching API calls over to AXIOS
--Mobile responsiveness
--Initial load issues with zustand need fixed
--Payment success screen (ORDER CONFIRMATION SCREEN) should maybe mention receiving an email about the order instead of saying the order has been confirmed (can send out an email from stripe webhook API if successful)
--login/login issue
--Need to try and bring screens away from "use client" utilize the server more.
--Seperate some logic out into hooks
--Internal code cleanup and reflect on project structure (make changes where best suited)
